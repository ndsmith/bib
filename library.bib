	Abstract = {In this article and its sequel, we derive Bayesianism from the following norm: Accuracy---an agent ought to minimize the inaccuracy of her partial beliefs. In this article, we make this norm mathematically precise. We describe epistemic dilemmas an agent might face if she attempts to follow Accuracy and show that the only measures of inaccuracy that do not create these dilemmas are the quadratic inaccuracy measures. In the sequel, we derive Bayesianism from Accuracy and show that Jeffrey Condi- tionalization violates Accuracy unless Rigidity is assumed.We describe the alternative updating rule that Accuracy mandates in the absence of Rigidity.},

@article{Zapata2009,
	Abstract = {Pectin is a polysaccharide of vegetal origin widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries, among others, due to its particular physicochemical properties. Pectin solubilizing activity of Protopectinase-SE, an enzyme produced by the yeast-like fungus Geotrichum klebahnii, was studied using lemon albedo (the inner white and spongy part of the peel) and protopectin (the water insoluble pectic substance obtained from the same tissue) as substrates. Effects of substrate particle size and composition, pH and temperature of reaction medium were evaluated using a Doehlert experimental design with response surface. Temperature, pH and buffer (citric acid-sodium citrate, CitB) concentration display an important effect on pectin solubilization process, with optimal solubilization conditions at pH 5.0, 37$\,^{\circ}$C and CitB = 25 mM. Yield of 37 and 28 g of pectin/100 g tissue (dry basis) are achieved under optimal reaction conditions from protopectin and albedo, respectively. In both cases, extracted pectin shows a 60\% uronic acid content and 78\% esterification grade.},

@article{Wilson2010b,
	Abstract = {It has been argued that Hume's account of testimony is seriously inadequate: an autonomous knower of the sort Hume defends cannot, through simple inductive methods, justify accepting another's testimony as true. This conclusion is no doubt correct. But Hume does not defend the idea of an autonomous knower, nor does he defend relying upon simple inductive methods. An examination of Hume's critique of Descartes's method of doubt shows him as a defender of what might be called the responsible knower, and reveals the sophistication of the inductive methods he wishes to defend. It is shown that Hume can and does use these methods to justify accepting the testimony of others.},

@book{Frankish2009b,
	Abstract = {About the book: The idea that belief comes in degrees is based on the observation that we are more certain of some things than of others. Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

@article{Williamson2014,
	Abstract = {The paper is a critique of the widespread conception of logic as a neutral arbiter between metaphysical theories, one that makes no `substantive' claims of its own (David Kaplan and John Etchemendy are two recent examples). A familiar observation is that virtually every putatively fundamental principle of logic has been challenged over the last century on broadly metaphysical grounds (however mistaken), with a consequent proliferation of alternative logics. However, this apparent contentiousness of logic is often treated as though it were neutralized by the possibility of studying all these alternative logics within an agreed metalogical framework, typically that of first-order logic with set theory. In effect, metalogic is given the role of neutral arbiter. The paper will consider a variety of examples in which deep logical disputes re-emerge at the meta-level. One case is quantified modal logic, where some varieties of actualism require a modal meta-language (as opposed to the usual non-modal language of possible worlds model theory) in order not to make their denial of the Barcan formula self-defeating. Similarly, on some views the intended model theory for second-order logic can only be given in a second-order metalanguage---this may be needed to avoid versions of Russell's paradox when the first-order quantifiers are read as absolutely unrestricted. It can be shown that the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness eventually forces fuzzy logical treatments of vagueness to use a fuzzy metalanguage, with consequent repercussions for what first-order principles are validated. The difficulty of proving the completeness of first-order intuitionistic logic on its intended interpretation by intuitionistically rather than just classically valid means is a more familiar example. These case studies will be discussed in some detail to reveal a variety of ways in which even metalogic is metaphysically contested, substantial and non-neutral.},

@article{MacFarlane2009,
	Abstract = {Philosophers on all sides of the contextualism debates have had an overly narrow conception of what semantic context sensitivity could be. They have conflated context sensitivity (dependence of truth or extension on features of context) with indexicality (dependence of content on features of context). As a result of this conflation, proponents of contextualism have taken arguments that establish only context sensitivity to establish indexicality, while opponents of contextualism have taken arguments against indexicality to be arguments against context sensitivity. Once these concepts are carefully pulled apart, it becomes clear that there is conceptual space in semantic theory for nonindexical forms of contextualism that have many advantages over the usual indexical forms.},

@article{Barrett2008,
	Abstract = {Why have humans, throughout history and across cultures, shown a strong tendency to believe in the existence of superhuman intentional agents and attached this belief to notions of morality, misfortune, and the creation of the world? The answer emerging from the cognitive science of religion appears to be that explicit beliefs are informed and constrained by the natural and cross-culturally recurrent operation of implicit cognitive systems. Successful god concepts resonate with the expectations of these implicit systems but also have attention-demanding and inferentially-rich properties that allow their integration into various areas of human concern. Theological concepts may deviate from these natural cognitive moorings but require special cultural scaffolding, such as Whitehouse's two Modes of Religiosity, to do so and constitute additions to, rather than replacements of the religious beliefs supported by implicit cognitive systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {In <I>Notebooks 1914-1916<D>, Wittgenstein considers two related arguments to prove the transcendence of ethics. The inferences involve the claim that the existence of ethics must be indifferent to whether or not the world is inhabited by living things, and that moral good and evil occur only because of the extraworldly metaphysical subject. I reconstruct and criticize these arguments in detail as a prelude to analyzing Wittgenstein's <I>Tractatus<D> remarks about the transcendence of value, the identification of ethics and aesthetics as one, and the elimination of theoretical ethics or metaethics as meaningless pseudopropositions.},

I argue, however, that on closer inspection causal `nominalism' collapses into either a version of realism or a mere variant of one of the traditional nominalist approaches. In the case of Whittle's specific brand of causal nominalism, I suggest it is best thought of as a version of what Armstrong calls `ostrich' nominalism, a view which ultimately refuses to acknowledge the one over many problem rather than provide a solution to it.},

Results were positive, supporting the view that, from a young age, children appeal to mental states--goals, perceptions, and beliefs--to explain the behavior of others.},

@article{Turner2010,
	Abstract = {According to orthodoxy, the contents of propositional attitudes are, well, propositions. To believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a proposition. On an alternative account, developed and defended by David Lewis (1979) and Roderick Chisholm (1979 and 1981), the contents of the attitudes are not propositions but properties: to believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a property. Call this alternative the property theory. Its chief advantage over orthodoxy is its superior handling of the irreducibly first-personal de se attitudes. Not knowing I am looking in a mirror, I see a man with an inkspot on his collar and say to myself, ``His collar is stained.'' I may believe that Jason Turner's collar is stained---perhaps, thanks to selective amnesia, I remember what Jason Turner looks like but not that I am he---but, until I realize it is a mirror I am looking in, I still lack the belief that my collar is stained. What I lack is a de se belief.},

@article{Frankish2009,
	Abstract = {About the book: The idea that belief comes in degrees is based on the observation that we are more certain of some things than of others. Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

	Abstract = {Modern empiricism has been conditioned in large part by two dogmas. One is a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are analytic, or grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact, and truth which are synthetic, or grounded in fact. The other dogma is reductionism: the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience. Both dogmas, I shall argue, are ill founded. One effect of abandoning them is, as we shall see, a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science. Another effect is a shift toward pragmatism},

@article{Hicks1936,
	Abstract = {George Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, was one of the great philosophersof the early modern period. He was a brilliant critic of hispredecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke. He was atalented metaphysician famous for defending idealism, that is, theview that reality consists exclusively of minds and theirideas. Berkeley's system, while it strikes many as counter-intuitive,is strong and flexible enough to counter most objections. Hismost-studied works, the Treatise Concerning the Principles ofHuman Knowledge (Principles, for short) and ThreeDialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), arebeautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delightcontemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker withinterests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophicalmotivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,economics, and medicine.  Although many of Berkeley's first readersgreeted him with incomprehension, he influenced both Hume and Kant,and is much read (if little followed) in our own day.,  (2) We perceive only ideas.,  (2) But because of the mind-dependent status of ideas, they cannothave any characteristics which they are not perceived to have.,  Philonous.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can anidea exist without being actually perceived?  These are pointslong since agreed between us. (3D 234) ,  Philonous. He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actuallyperceives; but in the inferences he makes from his present perceptions.Thus in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight iscertainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thenceconclude, that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceivethe same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch, as crookedthings are wont to do: in that he is mistaken.

	Abstract = {In this paper I argue for a doctrine I call ?infallibilism?, which I stipulate to mean that If S knows that p, then the epistemic probability of p for S is 1. Some fallibilists will claim that this doctrine should be rejected because it leads to scepticism. Though it's not obvious that infallibilism does lead to scepticism, I argue that we should be willing to accept it even if it does. Infallibilism should be preferred because it has greater explanatory power than fallibilism. In particular, I argue that an infallibilist can easily explain why assertions of ?p, but possibly not-p? (where the ?possibly? is read as referring to epistemic possibility) is infelicitous in terms of the knowledge rule of assertion. But a fallibilist cannot. Furthermore, an infallibilist can explain the infelicity of utterances of ?p, but I don't know that p? and ?p might be true, but I'm not willing to say that for all I know, p is true?, and why when a speaker thinks p is epistemically possible for her, she will agree (if asked) that for all she knows, p is true. The simplest explanation of these facts entails infallibilism. Fallibilists have tried and failed to explain the infelicity of ?p, but I don't know that p?, but have not even attempted to explain the last two facts. I close by considering two facts that seem to pose a problem for infallibilism, and argue that they don't.$\backslash$nIn this paper I argue for a doctrine I call ?infallibilism?, which I stipulate to mean that If S knows that p, then the epistemic probability of p for S is 1.

(where the ?possibly? is read as referring to epistemic possibility) is infelicitous in terms of the knowledge rule of assertion. But a fallibilist cannot. Furthermore, an infallibilist can explain the infelicity of utterances of ?p, but I don't know that p? and ?p might be true, but I'm not willing to say that for all I know, p is true?, and why when a speaker thinks p is epistemically possible for her, she will agree (if asked) that for all she knows, p is true. The simplest explanation of these facts entails infallibilism. Fallibilists have tried and failed to explain the infelicity of ?p, but I don't know that p?, but have not even attempted to explain the last two facts. I close by considering two facts that seem to pose a problem for infallibilism, and argue that they don't.},

@article{Sober2009,
	Abstract = {Absence of evidence isnt evidence of absence is a slogan that is popular among scientists and nonscientists alike. This article assesses its truth by using a probabilistic tool, the Law of Likelihood. Qualitative questions (Is E evidence about H?) and quantitative questions (How much evidence does E provide about H?) are both considered. The article discusses the example of fossil intermediates. If finding a fossil that is phenotypically intermediate between two extant species provides evidence that those species have a common ancestor, does failing to find such a fossil constitute evidence that there was no common ancestor? Or should the failure merely be chalked up to the imperfection of the fossil record? The transitivity of the evidence relation in simple causal chains provides a broader context, which leads to discussion of the fine-tuning argument, the anthropic principle, and observation selection effects.},

@article{Basu2003,
	Abstract = {This paper attempts to argue for the theory-ladenness of evidence. It does so by employing and analysing an episode from the history of eighteenth century chemistry. It delineates attempts by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier to construct entirely different kinds of evidence for and against a particular hypothesis from a set of agreed upon observations or (raw) data. Based on an augmented version of a distinction, drawn by J. Bogen and J. Woodward, between data and phenomena it is shown that the role of theoretical auxiliary assumptions is very important in constructing evidence for (or against) a theory from observation or (raw) data. In revolutionary situations, rival groups hold radically different theories and theoretical auxiliary assumptions. These are employed to construct very different evidence from the agreed upon set of observations or (raw) data. Hence, theory resolution becomes difficult. It is argued that evidence construction is a multi-layered exercise and can be disputed at any level. What counts as unproblematic observation or (raw) data at one level may become problematic at another level. The contingency of these constructions and the (un)problematic nature of evidence are shown to be partially dependent upon the scientific knowledge that the scientific community possesses. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Williamson2010,
	Abstract = {Necessitism is the view that necessarily everything is necessarily something; contingentism is the negation of necessitism. The dispute between them is reminiscent of, but clearer than, the more familiar one between possibilism and actualism. A mapping often used to `translate' actualist discourse into possibilist discourse is adapted to map every sentence of a first-order modal language to a sentence the contingentist (but not the necessitist) may regard as equivalent to it but which is neutral in the dispute. This mapping enables the necessitist to extract a `cash value' from what the contingentist says. Similarly, a mapping often used to `translate' possibilist discourse into actualist discourse is adapted to map every sentence of the language to a sentence the necessitist (but not the contingentist) may regard as equivalent to it but which is neutral in the dispute. This mapping enables the contingentist to extract a `cash value' from what the necessitist says. Neither mapping is a translation in the usual sense, since necessitists and contingentists use the same language with the same meanings. The former mapping is extended to a second-order modal language under a plural interpretation of the second-order variables. It is proved that the latter mapping cannot be. Thus although the necessitist can extract a `cash value' from what the contingentist says in the second-order language, the contingentist cannot extract a `cash value' from some of what the necessitist says, even when it raises significant questions. This poses contingentism a serious challenge.},

	Abstract = {According to the Doomsday Argument we have to rethink the probabilities we assign to a soon or not so soon extinction ofmankind when we realize that we are living now, rather early in the history of mankind. Sleeping Beauty finds herself in a similar predicament: on learning the date of her first awakening, she is asked to re-evaluate the probabilities of her two possible future scenarios. In connection with Doom, I argue that it is wrong to assume that our ordinary probability judgements do not already reflect our place in history: we justify the predictive use we make of the probabilities yielded by science (or other sources of information) by our knowledge of the fact that we live now, a certain time before the possible occurrence of the events the probabilities refer to. Our degrees of belief should change drastically when we forget the date---importantly, this follows without invoking the ``Self Indication Assumption''. Subsequent conditionalization on information about which year it is cancels this probability shift again. The Doomsday Argument is about such probability shifts, but tells us nothing about the concrete values of the probabilities---for these, experience provides the only basis. Essentially the same analysis applies to the Sleeping Beauty problem. I argue that Sleeping Beauty ``thirders'' should be committed to thinking that the Doomsday Argument is ineffective; whereas ``halfers'' should agree that doom is imminent---but they are wrong.},

@article{Hawthorne1999,
	Abstract = {John Locke proposed a straightforward relationship between qualitative and quantitative doxastic notions: belief corresponds to a sufficiently high degree of confidence. Richard Foley has further developed this Lockean thesis and applied it to an analysis of the preface and lottery paradoxes. Following Foley's lead, we exploit various versions of these paradoxes to chart a precise relationship between belief and probabilistic degrees of confidence. The resolutions of these paradoxes emphasize distinct but complementary features of coherent belief. These features suggest principles that tie together qualitative and quantitative doxastic notions. We show how these principles may be employed to construct a quantitative model--in terms of degrees of confidence--of an agent's qualitative doxastic state. This analysis fleshes out the Lockean thesis and provides the foundation for a logic of belief that is responsive to the logic of degrees of confidence.},

Reliability attaches straightforwardly only to repeatable types of processes. Each sequence of concrete events causing a belief is a token of many belief-forming process types that vary widely in reliability. Reliabilists must provide a general method for identifying, for each token, the type whose reliability determines whether the token produces a justified belief. We examine and reject proposals based on common sense, science, and context. We also consider and reject the possibility that our way of posing the problem is ill conceived and no solution is needed.},

Indeed, holding science to a unanimity or near-unanimity standard has a pernicious effect on scientific deliberation, and on the transparency that is so crucial to the authority of science in a democracy. What authorizes a conclusion is the quality of the deliberation that produced it, which is enhanced by the presence of a non-dismissible minority. Scientists can speak as one in more ways than one. We recommend a different sort of consensus that is partly substantive and partly procedural. It is a version of what Margaret Gilbert calls $\backslash$textquotedblleft\{\}joint acceptance$\backslash$textquotedblright -- we call it $\backslash$textquotedblleft\{\}deliberative acceptance.$\backslash$textquotedblright It capitalizes on there being a persistent minority, and thereby encourages accurate reporting of the state of agreement and disagreement among deliberators.},

(D2) There is a continuum between imaginings and beliefs. Recog-nizing this continuum is crucial to explain the phenomenon of imaginative immersion. (D3) The mental states that relate to imaginings in the way that desires relate to beliefs are a special kind of desire, namely desires to make true in fiction. These desires to make true in fiction do not differ from regular desires in kind, but only in content.},

The construct of bullshit has received little scholarly attention; although it is known as a common phenomenon in academic speech and writing, it has rarely been the subject of empirical research. This study is comprised of a protocol analysis of one writer as she attempted to produce an academic essay on a topic in which her understanding of the plays content was insufficient for the task of producing the essay. The coding system identified subcodes within the major categories of content, genre, and process that enabled the researchers to infer what is involved in academic bullshitting. The analysis found that, in the absence of sufficient content knowledge, a writer familiar in discourse conventions may employ knowledge of the genre of academic writing and processes for producing generic features to create the impression that her content knowledge is adequate. The study concludes with a discussion of the phenomenon of academic bullshitting and its implications for teaching and learning academic writing.},

@article{Frankish2009a,
	Abstract = {About the book: The idea that belief comes in degrees is based on the observation that we are more certain of some things than of others. Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

@article{Giberman2012,
	Abstract = {A modus tollens against zero-dimensional material objects is presented from the premises (i) that if there are zero-dimensional material objects then there are bare particulars, and (ii) that there are no bare particulars. The argument for the first premise proceeds by elimination. First, bare particular theory and bundle theory are motivated as the most appealing theories of property exemplification. It is then argued that the bundle theorist's Ockhamism ought to lead her to reject spatiotemporally located zero-dimensional property instances. Finally, it is argued that since she must accept such instances if she accepts zero-dimensional material object bundles, she ought to avoid the latter. This leaves bare particular theory as the default view of zero-dimensional material objects. The argument for the second premise invokes the thesis that the exemplification of at least one sparse property is a prerequisite for the existence of any particular. It is argued from Humean considerations that bare particulars fail this prerequisite.},

	Abstract = {Can self-locating beliefs be relevant to non-self-locating claims? Traditional Bayesian modeling techniques have trouble answering this question because their updating rule fails when applied to situations involving contextsensitivity. This essay develops a fully general framework for modeling stories involving context-sensitive claims. The key innovations are a revised conditionalization rule and a principle relating models of the same story with different modeling languages. The essay then applies the modeling framework to the Sleeping Beauty Problem, showing that when Beauty awakens her degree of belief in heads should be one-third. This demonstrates that it can be rational for an agent who gains only self-locating beliefs between two times to alter her degree of belief in a non-self-locating claim.},

	Abstract = {Paul Grice's (1989) use of the term common ground to refer to background information presumed to be shared by participants in a conversation is argued to highlight the social character of speaker presuppositions, the abstract structure of which is clarified by introducing a simplifying assumption that identifies common ground with common belief. The logic of common belief is formalized in a highly idealized semantic framework that identifies belief with truth in all doxastic alternatives, which are represented by a binary relation of accessibility for each believer. Common beliefs \& individuals' beliefs about common beliefs are derived from ordinary individual beliefs, \& presupposition accommodation is characterized as a natural kind of belief change; a notion of common ground is developed in terms of acceptance to allow for divergence between common ground \& common belief due to accommodation to a recognition of defective contexts. 24 References.

	Abstract = {Abstract The typical explanation of an event or process which attracts the label conspiracy theory is an explanation that conflicts with the account advanced by the relevant epistemic authorities. I argue that both for the layperson and for the intellectual, it is almost never rational to accept such a conspiracy theory. Knowledge is not merely shallowly social, in the manner recognized by social epistemology, it is also constitutively social: many kinds of knowledge only become accessible thanks to the agent's embedding in an environment that includes other epistemic agents. Moreover, advances in knowledge typically require ongoing immersion in this social environment. But the intellectual who embraces a conspiracy theory risks cutting herself off from this environment, and therefore epistemically disabling herself. Embracing a conspiracy theory therefore places at risk the ability to engage in genuine enquiry, including the enquiry needed properly to evaluate the conspiracy theory.},

Epistemologists have engaged the issue of reasonable expert disagreement generally; here I consider a particular expert dispute in physics, given conflicting accounts from Harry Collins and Allan Franklin, over Joseph Weber's alleged detection of gravitational waves. Finding common ground between Collins and Franklin, I offer a characterization of the gravity wave dispute as both social and evidential. While experimental evidence alone may not have forced resolution of the dispute, there were also credibility-based reasons warranting epistemic trust and distrust. Thus, we see how social factors can have evidential significance and how expert disagreement can be reasonable.},

Hume appeals to shared experience and develops norms of belief from testimony that are not reductionist. It is argued that the reductionist interpretation rests on an overly narrow view of Hume's theory of ideas. By attending to such mechanisms of the imagination as abstraction and fictions, it is shown that Hume's theory of ideas does not forestall a nonreductionist social epistemology.},

Quine rejects this defense as resting on an untenable conception of analyticity. But, Carnap doesn't need analyticity. Holistic verificationism about theories, which he and Quine then shared, is sufficient to resurrect the claim that no new content results when abstract objects are added to the ontology of empirical theories. To defeat this claim, one must abandon reductionist views of theory content. This paper extends and deepens the discussion of an earlier publication on the same topic.},

While not everyone accepts that the secularization thesis has been decisively refuted, the resurgence of religion seems$\backslash$n to be a fact, one that can either be lamented or celebrated. Those who lament it often invoke the specter of religious violence: religion has a dangerous tendency to provoke and exacerbate violence wherever it is not domesticated and removed from public $\backslash$npower by the secular state. According to this line of thought, religion has this lamentable tendency because it is an essentially non-rational impulse, a passion that frequently eludes or exceeds the attempts of reason to tame it. The frightful specter of$\backslash$n religious fanaticism in the modern world is offered as evidence of the dan- gerous extremes to which untamed religious passion can tend if not brought to heel by a secular social order},

Second, Elga's and Lewis' treatments of the sleeping beauty case lead to highly counterintuitive consequences. The proposed account also leads to counterintuitive consequences, but they're not as bad as those of Elga's account, and no worse than those of Lewis' account.},

It has been argued that Probabilism follows, given the assumption that an epistemically rational agent ought to try to have credences that represent the world as accurately as possible. The key claim in this argument is that the goal of representing the world as accurately as possible is best served by having credences that are probabilistically coherent. This essay shows that this claim is false. In certain cases, the goal of having accurate credences is best served by being probabilistically incoherent. Assuming that an epistemically rational agent ought to try to have credences that are as accurate as possible, it follows that in certain cases a rational agent ought to have probabilistically incoherent credences.},

@article{Austin1994,
	Abstract = {Legal positivism is the thesis that the existence and content of lawdepends on social facts and not on its merits. The English jurist JohnAustin (1790-1859) formulated it thus: ``The existence of law isone thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not isone enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumedstandard, is a different enquiry.'' (1832, p. 157) The positivistthesis does not say that law's merits are unintelligible, unimportant,or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It says that they do notdetermine whether laws or legal systems exist. Whether asociety has a legal system depends on the presence of certainstructures of governance, not on the extent to which it satisfiesideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law. What laws are inforce in that system depends on what social standards its officialsrecognize as authoritative; for example, legislative enactments,judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a policy would bejust, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason forthinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust,unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason fordoubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has beenposited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might sayin a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a socialconstruction. Austin thought the thesis ``simple andglaring.'' While it is probably the dominant view amonganalytically inclined philosophers of law, it is also the subject ofcompeting interpretations together with persistent criticisms andmisunderstandings., (IP) It is not necessarily the case that there is a connectionbetween law and morality.},

	Abstract = {The term ``nonrational'' denotes a heterogeneous class of theories of decision making designed to overcome problems with traditional ``rational'' theories. Nonrational theories have been denoted by various terms, including models of bounded rationality, procedural rationality, and satisfi cing. Although there is as yet no agreed-upon defi nition of ``nonrational,'' rational and nonrational theories typically differ on several dimensions, discussed below. The term ``decision making'' is used broadly here to include preference, inference, classifi cation, and judgment, whether con- scious or unconscious. Nonrational theories of decision making should not be confused with theories of irrational decision making. The label ``nonrational'' signifi es a type of theory, not a type of outcome. In other words, the fact that nonrational theories postulate agents with emotions, limited knowl- edge, and little time---rather than postulating omniscient ``rational'' beings---need not imply that such agents fare badly in the real world.},

@article{Eriksson2007,
	Abstract = {Probabilism is committed to two theses: 1) Opinion comes in degrees-call them degrees of belief, or credences. 2) The degrees of belief of a rational agent obey the probability calculus. Correspondingly, a natural way to argue for probabilism is: i) to give an account of what degrees of belief are, and then ii) to show that those things should be probabilities, on pain of irrationality. Most of the action in the literature concerns stage ii). Assuming that stage i) has been adequately discharged, various authors move on to stage ii) with varied and ingenious arguments. But an unsatisfactory response at stage i) clearly undermines any gains that might be accrued at stage ii) as far as probabilism is concerned: if those things are not degrees of belief, then it is irrelevant to probabilism whether they should be probabilities or not. In this paper we scrutinize the state of play regarding stage i). We critically examine several of the leading accounts of degrees of belief: reducing them to corresponding betting behavior (de Finetti); measuring them by that behavior (Jeffrey); and analyzing them in terms of preferences and their role in decision-making more generally (Ramsey, Lewis, Maher). We argue that the accounts fail, and so they are unfit to subserve arguments for probabilism. We conclude more positively: 'degree of belief' should be taken as a primitive concept that forms the basis of our best theory of rational belief and decision: probabilism.},

To a first approximation, we can understand phenomenal evidence as determined by how our environment sensorily seems to us when we are experiencing. To a first approximation, we can understand factive evidence as necessarily determined by the environment to which we are perceptually related such that the evidence is guaranteed to be an accurate guide to the environment. I argue that the rational source of both phenomenal and factive evidence lies in employing perceptual capacities that we have in virtue of being perceivers.

@article{Lewis1994,
	Abstract = {Disturbance is a dominant factor in many ecosystems, and the disturbance regime is likely to change over the next decades in response to land-use changes and global warming. We assume that predictions of vegetation dynamics can be made on the basis of a set of life-history traits that characterize the response of a species to disturbance. For crown-fire ecosystems, the main plant traits related to postfire persistence are the ability to resprout (persistence of individuals) and the ability to retain a persistent seed bank (persistence of populations). In this context, we asked (1) to what extent do different life-history traits co-occur with the ability to resprout and/or the ability to retain a persistent seed bank among differing ecosystems and (2) to what extent do combinations of fire-related traits (fire syndromes) change in a fire regime gradient? We explored these questions by reviewing the literature and analyzing databases compiled from different crown-fire ecosystems (mainly eastern Australia, California, and the Mediterranean basin). The review suggests that the pattern of correlation between the two basic postfire persistent traits and other plant traits varies between continents and ecosystems. From these results we predict, for instance, that not all resprouters respond in a similar way everywhere because the associated plant traits of resprouter species vary in different places. Thus, attempts to generalize predictions on the basis of the resprouting capacity may have limited power at a global scale. An example is presented for Australian heathlands. Considering the combination of persistence at individual (resprouting) and at population (seed bank) level, the predictive power at local scale was significantly increased.

But there are cases in which two subjects have the same evidence for a proposition but, because of pragmatic factors, only one is justified. Our argument against evidentialism is not based on intuitions about these cases. Rather, we aim to provide a theoretical basis for rejecting evidentialism by defending a pragmatic necessary condition on epistemic justification: S is justified in believing that p only if S is rational to prefer as if p. Therefore, the price of evidentialism is skepticism. Contextualism, as a form of evidentialism, is in the same boat.},

	Abstract = {Fill in the blank: Truth is to belief, as \_\_\_ is to degree of belief. Orthodox Bayesianism requires exactly this much of you: your credences should be coherent---conform to the probability calculus---and they should change under the impact of new evidence by conditionalizing on that evidence. The scandal of orthodox Bayesianism is its extreme permissiveness, sanctioning as it does credences that are radically out of step with the world. We are hardly so tolerant when it comes to all-or- nothing beliefs: it is generally acknowledged that truth is a virtue (perhaps the most important one) that a belief may or may not have. What is the analogous virtue for a degree of belief? Van Fraassen, Lange and others would fill in the blank by appeal to the notion of calibration, a measure of the extent to which degrees of belief track corresponding relative frequencies. I marshal several arguments against this answer. My own answer is: agreement with objective chance. Some will complain that the notion of chance is mysterious, or even nonsense. I reply by pointing out several things that we know about chance. The centerpiece of my argument is a `magic trick': Give me any object, any number between 0 and 1 inclusive, and a specified accuracy, and I will use the object to generate an event whose chance is the number given to the accuracy specified.},

In spite of this fact, the analysis of where these priors come from and how they are formed has received little attention. It is reasonable to excuse the lack, in the foundational literature, of detailed psychological theory of what are the mechanisms by which prior probabilities are formed. But it is less excusable that there is an almost total absence of a detailed discussion of the highly differentiating nature of past experience in forming a prior. The focus here is on what kind of account, even if necessarily schematic, can be given about the psychological mechanisms back of the formation of Bayesian priors. The last section examines a detailed experiment relevant to how priors are learned. Keywords},

We argue that no relevant problem of the sort Fitelson supposes arises since his main theorem and his supporting arguments presuppose the validity of nonlinear transformations of credence functions that Joyce's theory, charitably construed, would identify as invalid on the basis of the principle of simple dominance.},

@article{Andersen2010,
	Abstract = {Recently, several scholars have argued that scientists can accept scientific claims in a collective process, and that the capacity of scientific groups to form joint acceptances is linked to a functional division of labor between the group members. However, these accounts reveal little about how the cognitive content of the jointly accepted claim is formed, and how group members depend on each other in this process. In this paper, I shall therefore argue that we need to link analyses of joint acceptance with analyses of distributed cognition. To sketch how this can be done, I shall present a detailed case study, and on the basis of the case, analyze the process through which a group of scientists jointly accept a new scientific claim and at a later stage jointly accept to revise previously accepted claims. I shall argue that joint acceptance in science can be established in situations where an overall conceptual structure is jointly accepted by a group of scientists while detailed parts of it are distributed among group members with different areas of expertise, a condition that I shall call a heterogeneous conceptual consensus. Finally, I shall show how a heterogeneous conceptual consensus can work as a constraint against scientific change and address the question how changes may nevertheless occur.},

@article{Source2011a,
	Abstract = {This article describes a theory of the computations underlying the selection of coordinated motion patterns, especially in reaching tasks. The central idea is that when a spatial target is selected as an object to be reached, stored postures are evaluated for the contributions they can make to the task. Weights are assigned to the stored postures, and a single target posture is found by taking a weighted sum of the stored postures. Movement is achieved by reducing the distance between the starting angle and target angle of each joint. The model explains compensation for reduced joint mobility, tool use, practice effects, performance errors, and aspects of movement kinematics. Extensions of the model can account for anticipation and coarticulation effects, movement through via points, and hierarchical control of series of movements. References: 170},

@article{gertler_underextint,
	Abstract = {Externalism about mental content is now widely accepted. It is therefore surprising that there is no established definition of externalism. I believe that this is a symptom of an unrecognized fact: that the labels 'mental content externalism'-and its complement 'mental content internalism'-are profoundly ambiguous. Under each of these labels falls a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting claims about the organism's contribution to thought contents, the nature of the self, relations between the individual and her community, and the epistemic availability of thoughts. This situation stems from the fact that contributors to debates about externalism differ in how they understand 'internal property'; these differences reveal (or, perhaps, generate) disparate conceptions of what is at issue in these debates. I argue that this situation is irremediable. There is no way to understand 'internal property' that will conform with prevailing beliefs about the nature of internalism and externalism, and with the usual taxonomy of leading positions. This ambiguity carries a heavy price: participants in these debates often argue at cross-purposes, disagreeing even on the nature of the evidence that could settle the question of externalism. Progress on the broad range of issues associated with these debates requires that we abandon the categories 'internalism' and 'externalism'. I close by suggesting a promising avenue for future research related to these issues.},

In this paper I want to contrast the way in which classical internalists and paradigm externalists might approach the question of how to construe the justification (if any) provided by testimony. In particular, I am interested in the question of whether testimonial inference has a fundamental or a derivative place in our reasoning. In the course of answering this question we will have occasion to examine more closely this alleged distinction between fundamental and derivative principles of reasoning.},

This question is at the center of the epistemology of testimony, and the current philosophical literature contains only two general options for answering it: reductionism and nonreductionism. While reductionists argue that testimonial justification is reducible to sense perception, memory, and inference, nonreductionists maintain that testimony is just as basic epistemically as these other sources. In this paper, I challenge the current terms of the debate by, first, showing that there are serious problems afflicting both reductionism and nonreductionism and by, second, developing a alternative view of testimonial justification.},

@book{christensen_putting_2004,
	Abstract = {The book explores the relations between these two ways of seeing beliefs. It argues that the binary conception, although it fits nicely with much of our common-sense thought and talk about belief, cannot in the end support the traditional deductive constraints on rational belief. Binary beliefs that obeyed these constraints could not answer to anything like our intuitive notion of epistemic rationality, and would end up having to be divorced from central aspects of our cognitive, practical, and emotional lives. But this does not mean that logic plays no role in rationality. Probabilistic coherence should be viewed as using standard logic to constrain rational graded belief. This probabilistic constraint helps explain the appeal of the traditional deductive constraints, and even underlies the force of rationally persuasive deductive arguments. Graded belief cannot be defined in terms of preferences. But probabilistic coherence may be defended without positing definitional connections between beliefs and preferences. Like the traditional deductive constraints, coherence is a logical ideal that humans cannot fully attain. Nevertheless, it furnishes a compelling way of understanding a key dimension of epistemic rationality.},

He contends that Christian beliefs are warranted to the extent that they are formed by properly functioning cognitive faculties, thus, insofar as they are warranted, Christian beliefs are knowledge if they are true.

Metametaphysics asks questions about metaphysics: for example, do its questions have determinate answers? If so, are these answers deep and important, or are they merely a matter of how we use words? What is the proper methodology for their resolution? These questions have received a heightened degree of attention lately with new varieties of ontological deflationism and pluralism challenging the kind of realism that has become orthodoxy in contemporary analytic metaphysics. This volume concerns the status and ambitions of metaphysics as a discipline. It brings together many of the central figures in the debate with their most recent work on the semantics, epistemology, and methodology of metaphysics. (publisher)},

I argue for this claim by analogy with an intuitively more plausible principle for memorial justification: a subject's belief can be justified on the basis of the reason the subject once possessed for the belief, even if the subject no longer possesses that reason. Tyler Burge's well known account of testimonial entitlement is inconsistent with what I say, so I criticize his account in defending my argument. I also criticize an attempt by David Owens to reconcile the position I defend with a social responsibilism about justification.},

	Abstract = {This volume examines the philosophical challenge that religious diversity poses for religious belief. Featuring contributors from philosophy, religious studies, and theology, it is unified by the way in which the authors engage in sustained critical examination of one another's positions. John Hick's pluralism provides one focal point of the collection. Hick argues that all the major religious traditions make contact with the same ultimate reality, all offering equally effective paths to salvation or liberation. Another central position is William P. Alston's defense of the Christian practice of forming beliefs about manifestations of God in response to experiences of divine presence or activity. Articles by Hick and Alston develop their arguments and other selections respond. Religious skepticism, religious exclusivism, religious inclusivism, and other perspectives are also represented.
