@article{gertler_underextint,
	Abstract = {Externalism about mental content is now widely accepted. It is therefore surprising that there is no established definition of externalism. I believe that this is a symptom of an unrecognized fact: that the labels 'mental content externalism'-and its complement 'mental content internalism'-are profoundly ambiguous. Under each of these labels falls a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting claims about the organism's contribution to thought contents, the nature of the self, relations between the individual and her community, and the epistemic availability of thoughts. This situation stems from the fact that contributors to debates about externalism differ in how they understand 'internal property'; these differences reveal (or, perhaps, generate) disparate conceptions of what is at issue in these debates. I argue that this situation is irremediable. There is no way to understand 'internal property' that will conform with prevailing beliefs about the nature of internalism and externalism, and with the usual taxonomy of leading positions. This ambiguity carries a heavy price: participants in these debates often argue at cross-purposes, disagreeing even on the nature of the evidence that could settle the question of externalism. Progress on the broad range of issues associated with these debates requires that we abandon the categories 'internalism' and 'externalism'. I close by suggesting a promising avenue for future research related to these issues.},

In this paper I want to contrast the way in which classical internalists and paradigm externalists might approach the question of how to construe the justification (if any) provided by testimony. In particular, I am interested in the question of whether testimonial inference has a fundamental or a derivative place in our reasoning. In the course of answering this question we will have occasion to examine more closely this alleged distinction between fundamental and derivative principles of reasoning.},

This question is at the center of the epistemology of testimony, and the current philosophical literature contains only two general options for answering it: reductionism and nonreductionism. While reductionists argue that testimonial justification is reducible to sense perception, memory, and inference, nonreductionists maintain that testimony is just as basic epistemically as these other sources. In this paper, I challenge the current terms of the debate by, first, showing that there are serious problems afflicting both reductionism and nonreductionism and by, second, developing a alternative view of testimonial justification.},

@book{christensen_putting_2004,
	Abstract = {The book explores the relations between these two ways of seeing beliefs. It argues that the binary conception, although it fits nicely with much of our common-sense thought and talk about belief, cannot in the end support the traditional deductive constraints on rational belief. Binary beliefs that obeyed these constraints could not answer to anything like our intuitive notion of epistemic rationality, and would end up having to be divorced from central aspects of our cognitive, practical, and emotional lives. But this does not mean that logic plays no role in rationality. Probabilistic coherence should be viewed as using standard logic to constrain rational graded belief. This probabilistic constraint helps explain the appeal of the traditional deductive constraints, and even underlies the force of rationally persuasive deductive arguments. Graded belief cannot be defined in terms of preferences. But probabilistic coherence may be defended without positing definitional connections between beliefs and preferences. Like the traditional deductive constraints, coherence is a logical ideal that humans cannot fully attain. Nevertheless, it furnishes a compelling way of understanding a key dimension of epistemic rationality.},

This is a coherent piece of metaphysics. But its epistemology is no clearer than ontology's.

On general epistemological grounds it is argued that none of our ways of forming beliefs can be shown, without circularity, to be reliable and a source of justification. Given this result, there is no reasonable alternative to taking socially established "practices" of belief formation to be prima facie rationally acceptable. This thesis is applied to the practice of forming beliefs about God on the basis of experience, and the practice is defended against a variety of objections.},

I argue for this claim by analogy with an intuitively more plausible principle for memorial justification: a subject's belief can be justified on the basis of the reason the subject once possessed for the belief, even if the subject no longer possesses that reason. Tyler Burge's well known account of testimonial entitlement is inconsistent with what I say, so I criticize his account in defending my argument.

Featuring contributors from philosophy, religious studies, and theology, it is unified by the way in which the authors engage in sustained critical examination of one another's positions. John Hick's pluralism provides one focal point of the collection. Hick argues that all the major religious traditions make contact with the same ultimate reality, all offering equally effective paths to salvation or liberation. Another central position is William P. Alston's defense of the Christian practice of forming beliefs about manifestations of God in response to experiences of divine presence or activity. Articles by Hick and Alston develop their arguments and other selections respond. Religious skepticism, religious exclusivism, religious inclusivism, and other perspectives are also represented.

The second misconception is that anyone who endorses a reductionist position regarding the epistemic status of testimony, and so who denies the existence of testimony-specific epistemic principles, ipso facto ought to be hostile to the hypothesis that testimonial knowledge is epistemically distinctive. I argue against both misconceptions by arguing for the distinctiveness hypothesis in a way that involves no premise any reductionist should want to deny.},

Three unifying ideas run through the book. The first is that what is uniquely human is the capacity for metamental ascent, the ability to consider and evaluate first-order mental states (such as beliefs and desires) that arise naturally within us. The second unifying idea is that we have a system for such reflective evaluation which yields acceptance (in relation to beliefs) or preference (in relation to the objects of desires). The third unifying idea is that there are 'keystones' of evaluation in this system: loops of trustworthiness that are themselves supported by the structure that they hold together. Self-trust is the basis of our trustworthiness, on which reason, knowledge, and wisdom are grounded.(publisher, edited)},
