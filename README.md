# My `.bib` Library

### Info

I use this primarily for keeping my main `.bib` file up to date across machines. It allows me to track changes over time, and to merge disparate versions with ease.

### Contributing

While this repository is in continual use, I rarely check for pull requests. So far, this practice has been unproblematic since no pull request has ever occurred. That said, contributions are quite welcome. Just be warned that the approval might take a while.

### Formatting

I started using LaTeX and Bib some time ago. I was a bit too casual initially, causing inconsistencies in citekey formatting. I have also occasionally neglected to input the location of certain publishers. As I come across mistakes of this sort I will clean things up. However I have yet to complete this cleanup.

### The Future

I am interested in eventually conforming my bibliography to the database over at PhilPapers.org. But perhaps this is a pipe dream since I seem to find a lot of other interesting things to do aside from spending copious time on updating a `.bib` library that already (mostly) works!
