# My `.bib` Library

###Info

I use this primarily for keeping my main `.bib` file up to date across  machines. It also serves as a backup and version control (although the version control is really unnecessary).

###Contributing

Since this is primarily for my own use, I will probably not approve any pull requests. If you feel compelled to contribute, you can always make a pull request and see what I do. No promises!

###Formatting

I am a bit inconsistent when structuring citekeys. I generally prefer them to take the form `lastname_abreviated-title` but I occasionally will use the publication year in place of the abbreviate title. Maybe I'll eventually clean this up. Again, no promises!
