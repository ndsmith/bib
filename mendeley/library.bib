The analysis of the ordinary language to clarify philosophical questions is the common element of the 13 papers. Chapters 2 and 4 discuss the nature of knowledge, focusing on \"{A}\`{o}performative utterances\"{A}\^{o}. The doctrine of \"{A}\`{o}speech acts\"{A}\^{o}, i.e. a statement may be the pragmatic use of language, is discussed in Chs 6 and 10. Chapters 8, 9, and 12 reflect on the problems the language encounters in discussing actions and consider the cases of excuses, accusations, and freedom. The \"{A}\`{o}correspondence theory\"{A}\^{o}, i.e. a statement is truth when it corresponds to a fact, is presented in Chs 5 and 6. Finally, Chs 1 and 3 study how a word may have different but related senses considering Aristotle\"{A}\^{o}s view. Chapters 11 and 13 illustrate the meaning of \"{A}\`{o}pretending\"{A}\^{o} and a Plato\"{A}\^{o}s text respectively.},

abstract = {Pectin is a polysaccharide of vegetal origin widely used in food and pharmaceutical industries, among others, due to its particular physicochemical properties. Pectin solubilizing activity of Protopectinase-SE, an enzyme produced by the yeast-like fungus Geotrichum klebahnii, was studied using lemon albedo (the inner white and spongy part of the peel) and protopectin (the water insoluble pectic substance obtained from the same tissue) as substrates. Effects of substrate particle size and composition, pH and temperature of reaction medium were evaluated using a Doehlert experimental design with response surface. Temperature, pH and buffer (citric acid-sodium citrate, CitB) concentration display an important effect on pectin solubilization process, with optimal solubilization conditions at pH 5.0, 37°C and CitB = 25 mM. Yield of 37 and 28 g of pectin/100 g tissue (dry basis) are achieved under optimal reaction conditions from protopectin and albedo, respectively. In both cases, extracted pectin shows a 60\% uronic acid content and 78\% esterification grade.},

This conclusion is no doubt correct. But Hume does not defend the idea of an autonomous knower, nor does he defend relying upon simple inductive methods. An examination of Hume's critique of Descartes's method of doubt shows him as a defender of what might be called the responsible knower, and reveals the sophistication of the inductive methods he wishes to defend. It is shown that Hume can and does use these methods to justify accepting the testimony of others.},

abstract = {About the book: The idea that belief comes in degrees is based on the observation that we are more certain of some things than of others. Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

Perhaps the most intensively studied distress vocalization is the ultrasonic vocalization of infant rats. Since its discovery, this vocalization has been interpreted both as a communicatory signal for the elicitation of maternal retrieval and as the manifestation of emotional distress. In contrast, the authors examined the cardiovascular causes and consequences of the vocalization, and on the basis of this work, they hypothesized that the vocalization is the acoustic by-product of the abdominal compression reaction (ACR), a maneuver that results in increased venous return to the heart. Therefore, the vocalization may be analogous to a sneeze, serving a physiological function while incidentally producing sound.},

The thesis is that logic is relative to a structure. There are classical structures, intuitionistic structures, and (possibly) paraconsistent structures. Each such structure is a legitimate branch of mathematics, and there does not seem to be an interesting logic that is common to all of them. One main theme of my ante rem structuralism is that any coherent axiomatization describes a structure, or a class of structures. If one weakens the logic, then more axiomatizations become coherent.},

Unless this is so, metaphysical realists argue, noneof our beliefs about our world could be objectively true since truebeliefs tell us how things are and beliefs are objective when true orfalse independently of what anyone might think., The meaning of a mathematical statement determines and isexhaustively determined by its use. The meaning of a mathematicalstatement cannot be, or contain as an ingredient, anything which isnot manifest in the use made of it, lying solely in the mind of theindividual who apprehends that meaning: if two individual agreecompletely about the use to be made of the statement, then they agreeabout its meaning.

abstract = {The present paper argues for the relevance of Immanuel Kant and the German Enlightenment to contemporary social epistemology. Rather than distancing themselves from the alleged 'individualism' of Enlightenment philosophers, social epistemologists would be well-advised to look at the substantive discussion of social-epistemological questions in the works of Kant and other Enlightenment figures. After a brief rebuttal of the received view of the Enlightenment as an intrinsically individualist enterprise, this paper charts the historical trajectory of philosophical discussions of testimony as a source of knowledge, via such philosophers as C. Thomasius, C. A. Crusius, J. M. Chladenius, G. F. Meier, and finally Kant. Building on recent work on Kant's epistemology of testimony, the paper considers Kant's broader contributions to social epistemology. This includes an analysis of Kant's comments on the social basis of contingent epistemic standards, e.g., in the sciences, as well as on problems arising from the management of what Kant calls the growing 'volume of knowledge'. Special attention is paid to the relation between Kant's views and contemporary problems arising both in the context of education and from our increased reliance on scientific experts.},

Scientific theories are plausibly regarded as organized into hierarchies in many cases, with higher levels sometimes called 'paradigms' and lower levels encoding more specific or concrete hypotheses. Therefore, HBMs provide a useful model for scientific theory change, showing how higher-level theory change may be driven by the impact of evidence on lower levels. HBMs capture features described in the Kuhnian tradition, particularly the idea that higher-level theories guide learning at lower levels. In addition, they help resolve certain issues for Bayesians, such as scientific preference for simplicity and tbe problem of new theories.},

@article{Hawthorne2006,
abstract = {As is well known, Aristotelian natural philosophy, and many other systems of natural philosophy since, have relied heavily on teleology and teleological causation. Somehow, the purpose or end of an obj ect can be used to predict and explain what that object does: once you know that the end of an acorn is to become an oak, and a few things about what sorts of circumstances are conducive to the attainment of this end, you can predict a lot about the sprouting of the acorn and the subsequent behaviour of the piece of vegetation that results. Once you know that a rock seeks to move towards the centre of the Earth, you gain some insight into why it falls when released, and why it deforms the carpet or foot that it lands on. Once you know that the rabbit seeks to preserve itself, you can predict it will run from the fox. And so on. There are at least three features of Aristotle$\backslash$textquoteright\{\}s teleology, and more generally of an Aristotelian frame of mind about teleology, that may induce suspicion. One is that an end can serve as a "cause": as well as the sort of causation we all recognize, efficient causation, there are other forms, one of which is teleological causation. However, this can look less odd if we think of causes as things that figure in "because" answers to "why" questions. Whether or not self-preservation, or the rabbit$\backslash$textquoteright\{\}s continued existence, or something similar, causes the rabbit to run, the reply "because it seeks to continue in existence" certainly makes sense as an answer, or part of an answer, to a question about why it ran from the fox.

Against vlastos we argue that the first two steps of the argument are not inconsistent, Nor are they related as premise to conclusion. To support the former claim we translate the first and last steps by placing 'one' in the predicate position. This conforms to the eleatic use which was adopted by plato. To support the latter we give an assumption (t) from which all the steps are generated. Parmenides shows that each form is one and many. Hence plato's modified parmenidianism is refuted.},

@article{Williamson2014,
abstract = {The paper is a critique of the widespread conception of logic as a neutral arbiter between metaphysical theories, one that makes no `substantive’ claims of its own (David Kaplan and John Etchemendy are two recent examples). A familiar observation is that virtually every putatively fundamental principle of logic has been challenged over the last century on broadly metaphysical grounds (however mistaken), with a consequent proliferation of alternative logics. However, this apparent contentiousness of logic is often treated as though it were neutralized by the possibility of studying all these alternative logics within an agreed metalogical framework, typically that of first-order logic with set theory. In effect, metalogic is given the role of neutral arbiter. The paper will consider a variety of examples in which deep logical disputes re-emerge at the meta-level. One case is quantified modal logic, where some varieties of actualism require a modal meta-language (as opposed to the usual non-modal language of possible worlds model theory) in order not to make their denial of the Barcan formula self-defeating. Similarly, on some views the intended model theory for second-order logic can only be given in a second-order metalanguage—this may be needed to avoid versions of Russell’s paradox when the first-order quantifiers are read as absolutely unrestricted. It can be shown that the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness eventually forces fuzzy logical treatments of vagueness to use a fuzzy metalanguage, with consequent repercussions for what first-order principles are validated. The difficulty of proving the completeness of first-order intuitionistic logic on its intended interpretation by intuitionistically rather than just classically valid means is a more familiar example. These case studies will be discussed in some detail to reveal a variety of ways in which even metalogic is metaphysically contested, substantial and non-neutral.},

They have conflated context sensitivity (dependence of truth or extension on features of context) with indexicality (dependence of content on features of context). As a result of this conflation, proponents of contextualism have taken arguments that establish only context sensitivity to establish indexicality, while opponents of contextualism have taken arguments against indexicality to be arguments against context sensitivity. Once these concepts are carefully pulled apart, it becomes clear that there is conceptual space in semantic theory for nonindexical forms of contextualism that have many advantages over the usual indexical forms.},

The first is that what is uniquely human is the capacity for metamental ascent, the ability to consider and evaluate first-order mental states (such as beliefs and desires) that arise naturally within us. The second unifying idea is that we have a system for such reflective evaluation which yields acceptance (in relation to beliefs) or preference (in relation to the objects of desires). The third unifying idea is that there are 'keystones' of evaluation in this system: loops of trustworthiness that are themselves supported by the structure that they hold together. Self-trust is the basis of our trustworthiness, on which reason, knowledge, and wisdom are grounded.(publisher, edited)},

The answer emerging from the cognitive science of religion appears to be that explicit beliefs are informed and constrained by the natural and cross-culturally recurrent operation of implicit cognitive systems. Successful god concepts resonate with the expectations of these implicit systems but also have attention-demanding and inferentially-rich properties that allow their integration into various areas of human concern. Theological concepts may deviate from these natural cognitive moorings but require special cultural scaffolding, such as Whitehouse's two Modes of Religiosity, to do so and constitute additions to, rather than replacements of the religious beliefs supported by implicit cognitive systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we used a novel nonverbal task to examine 15-month-old infants' ability to predict an actor's behavior on the basis of her true or false belief about a toy's hiding place. Results were positive, supporting the view that, from a young age, children appeal to mental states--goals, perceptions, and beliefs--to explain the behavior of others.},

abstract = {According to orthodoxy, the contents of propositional attitudes are, well, propositions. To believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a proposition. On an alternative account, developed and defended by David Lewis (1979) and Roderick Chisholm (1979 and 1981), the contents of the attitudes are not propositions but properties: to believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a property. Call this alternative the property theory. Its chief advantage over orthodoxy is its superior handling of the irreducibly first-personal de se attitudes. Not knowing I am looking in a mirror, I see a man with an inkspot on his collar and say to myself, “His collar is stained.” I may believe that Jason Turner’s collar is stained—perhaps, thanks to selective amnesia, I remember what Jason Turner looks like but not that I am he—but, until I realize it is a mirror I am looking in, I still lack the belief that my collar is stained. What I lack is a de se belief.},

abstract = {About the book: The idea that belief comes in degrees is based on the observation that we are more certain of some things than of others. Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

He was a brilliant critic of hispredecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke. He was atalented metaphysician famous for defending idealism, that is, theview that reality consists exclusively of minds and theirideas. Berkeley's system, while it strikes many as counter-intuitive,is strong and flexible enough to counter most objections. Hismost-studied works, the Treatise Concerning the Principles ofHuman Knowledge (Principles, for short) and ThreeDialogues between Hylas and Philonous (Dialogues), arebeautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delightcontemporary philosophers. He was also a wide-ranging thinker withinterests in religion (which were fundamental to his philosophicalmotivations), the psychology of vision, mathematics, physics, morals,economics, and medicine.  Although many of Berkeley's first readersgreeted him with incomprehension, he influenced both Hume and Kant,and is much read (if little followed) in our own day.,  (2) We perceive only ideas.,  (2) But because of the mind-dependent status of ideas, they cannothave any characteristics which they are not perceived to have.,  Philonous.  And what is perceivable but an idea? And can anidea exist without being actually perceived?  These are pointslong since agreed between us. (3D 234) ,  Philonous. He is not mistaken with regard to the ideas he actuallyperceives; but in the inferences he makes from his present perceptions.Thus in the case of the oar, what he immediately perceives by sight iscertainly crooked; and so far he is in the right. But if he thenceconclude, that upon taking the oar out of the water he shall perceivethe same crookedness; or that it would affect his touch, as crookedthings are wont to do: in that he is mistaken.

abstract = {The diary passage at Section 258 of Wittgenstein's <I>Philosophical Investigations<D> is often considered the key to his "private language argument" (or PLA). This paper attempts to provide a clear and persuasive account of Section 258. After some observations about method, the gist of which is that the PLA is a myth, and about the context in which Section 258 occurs, I consider briefly its initial statements, <I>a<D> through <I>l<D>. My concluding sentence by sentence and between the sentences account of the famous last four lines of Section 258 include a reply to the major substantive objection to that part of the <I>Investigations<D>. The following are among the exegetical questions addressed. Wittgenstein says that the would-be private diarist has no criterion of correctness; but what justifies the presumption that one is needed? Furthermore, why does Wittgenstein think none is available? This crucial question gets different answers in the secondary literature; I argue that the standard ones fail. The interpretation of Section 258 offered here is a version of the meaning-based readings found in Kenny and Candlish, among others. Its key supposition is that statements about the past must be governed by criteria concerning the present or future.},

We prove the answer is 'yes', and that given some plausible logical postulates on belief that involve a contextual "cautiousness" threshold, there is but one way of determining the extension of the concept of belief that does the job. The qualitative concept of belief is not to be eliminated from scientific or philosophical discourse, rather, by reducing qualitative belief to assignments of resiliently high degrees of belief and a "cautiousness" threshold, qualitative and quantitative belief turn out to be governed by one unified theory that offers the prospects of a huge range of applications.

This article assesses its truth by using a probabilistic tool, the Law of Likelihood. Qualitative questions (Is E evidence about H?) and quantitative questions (How much evidence does E provide about H?) are both considered. The article discusses the example of fossil intermediates. If finding a fossil that is phenotypically intermediate between two extant species provides evidence that those species have a common ancestor, does failing to find such a fossil constitute evidence that there was no common ancestor? Or should the failure merely be chalked up to the imperfection of the fossil record? The transitivity of the evidence relation in simple causal chains provides a broader context, which leads to discussion of the fine-tuning argument, the anthropic principle, and observation selection effects.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to argue for the theory-ladenness of evidence. It does so by employing and analysing an episode from the history of eighteenth century chemistry. It delineates attempts by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier to construct entirely different kinds of evidence for and against a particular hypothesis from a set of agreed upon observations or (raw) data. Based on an augmented version of a distinction, drawn by J. Bogen and J. Woodward, between data and phenomena it is shown that the role of theoretical auxiliary assumptions is very important in constructing evidence for (or against) a theory from observation or (raw) data. In revolutionary situations, rival groups hold radically different theories and theoretical auxiliary assumptions. These are employed to construct very different evidence from the agreed upon set of observations or (raw) data. Hence, theory resolution becomes difficult. It is argued that evidence construction is a multi-layered exercise and can be disputed at any level. What counts as unproblematic observation or (raw) data at one level may become problematic at another level. The contingency of these constructions and the (un)problematic nature of evidence are shown to be partially dependent upon the scientific knowledge that the scientific community possesses. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Necessitism is the view that necessarily everything is necessarily something; contingentism is the negation of necessitism. The dispute between them is reminiscent of, but clearer than, the more familiar one between possibilism and actualism. A mapping often used to ‘translate’ actualist discourse into possibilist discourse is adapted to map every sentence of a first-order modal language to a sentence the contingentist (but not the necessitist) may regard as equivalent to it but which is neutral in the dispute. This mapping enables the necessitist to extract a ‘cash value’ from what the contingentist says. Similarly, a mapping often used to ‘translate’ possibilist discourse into actualist discourse is adapted to map every sentence of the language to a sentence the necessitist (but not the contingentist) may regard as equivalent to it but which is neutral in the dispute. This mapping enables the contingentist to extract a ‘cash value’ from what the necessitist says. Neither mapping is a translation in the usual sense, since necessitists and contingentists use the same language with the same meanings. The former mapping is extended to a second-order modal language under a plural interpretation of the second-order variables. It is proved that the latter mapping cannot be. Thus although the necessitist can extract a ‘cash value’ from what the contingentist says in the second-order language, the contingentist cannot extract a ‘cash value’ from some of what the necessitist says, even when it raises significant questions. This poses contingentism a serious challenge.},

abstract = {According to the Doomsday Argument we have to rethink the probabilities we assign to a soon or not so soon extinction ofmankind when we realize that we are living now, rather early in the history of mankind. Sleeping Beauty finds herself in a similar predicament: on learning the date of her first awakening, she is asked to re-evaluate the probabilities of her two possible future scenarios. In connection with Doom, I argue that it is wrong to assume that our ordinary probability judgements do not already reflect our place in history: we justify the predictive use we make of the probabilities yielded by science (or other sources of information) by our knowledge of the fact that we live now, a certain time before the possible occurrence of the events the probabilities refer to. Our degrees of belief should change drastically when we forget the date—importantly, this follows without invoking the “Self Indication Assumption”. Subsequent conditionalization on information about which year it is cancels this probability shift again. The Doomsday Argument is about such probability shifts, but tells us nothing about the concrete values of the probabilities—for these, experience provides the only basis. Essentially the same analysis applies to the Sleeping Beauty problem. I argue that Sleeping Beauty “thirders” should be committed to thinking that the Doomsday Argument is ineffective; whereas “halfers” should agree that doom is imminent—but they are wrong.},

@article{Hajek2003,
abstract = {Pascal's Wager is simply too good to be true-or better, too good to be sound. There must be something wrong with Pascal's argument that decision-theoretic reasoning shows that one must (resolve to) believe in God, if one is rational. No surprise, then, that critics of the argument are easily found, or that they have attacked it on many fronts. For Pascal has given them no dearth of targets. Virtually all of the Wager's critics have directed their campaigns against its premises. Other authors have rallied to its defense, buttressing those premises. I will argue that they are fighting a lost cause: devel- oping arguments byJeffrey (1983) and Duff (1986), I will contend that the Wager is simply invalid. This motivates a search for reformulations of the original argument that are valid, while upholding its spirit. I will offer four such reformulations, each of which finesses the decision matrix of the Wager, and in particular its problematic invocation of "infinite utility." Yet these reformulations fall too, albeit for a different reason. This, in turn, might prompt advocates of the Wager to conduct another search for still further reformulations. However, I will argue that such a search is likely to be futile. When we examine what is at the root of the failure of the original Wager, and of the reformulations that I offer, we realize that their failures are symptomatic of a deep problem that any variant of the Wager must overcome. I will present a dilemma for all such variants, and conclude that their prospects for success are dim.},

Richard Foley has further developed this Lockean thesis and applied it to an analysis of the preface and lottery paradoxes. Following Foley's lead, we exploit various versions of these paradoxes to chart a precise relationship between belief and probabilistic degrees of confidence. The resolutions of these paradoxes emphasize distinct but complementary features of coherent belief. These features suggest principles that tie together qualitative and quantitative doxastic notions. We show how these principles may be employed to construct a quantitative model--in terms of degrees of confidence--of an agent's qualitative doxastic state. This analysis fleshes out the Lockean thesis and provides the foundation for a logic of belief that is responsive to the logic of degrees of confidence.},

On general epistemological grounds it is argued that none of our ways of forming beliefs can be shown, without circularity, to be reliable and a source of justification. Given this result, there is no reasonable alternative to taking socially established "practices" of belief formation to be prima facie rationally acceptable. This thesis is applied to the practice of forming beliefs about God on the basis of experience, and the practice is defended against a variety of objections.},

abstract = {Van Fraassen maintains that the information that we can glean from experience is limited to those entities and processes that are detectable by means of our unaided senses. His challenge to the realist, I suggest, is that the attempt to inferentially transcend those limits amounts to a reversion to rationalism. Under pressure from such examples as microscopic observation, he has recently widened the scope of the phenomena to include object-like experiences without empirical objects of experience. With this change in mind, I argue that van Fraassen needs an account of perception whose consequence is that we can only see what we see with the unaided eye. I then argue that reflection on the epistemically significant aspects of the perceptual process renders van Fraassen's characterization of the limits of experience implausible; technologically enhanced perception brings "unobservable" within those limits. An empiricism that is compatible with realism results.},

Reliability attaches straightforwardly only to repeatable types of processes. Each sequence of concrete events causing a belief is a token of many belief-forming process types that vary widely in reliability. Reliabilists must provide a general method for identifying, for each token, the type whose reliability determines whether the token produces a justified belief. We examine and reject proposals based on common sense, science, and context. We also consider and reject the possibility that our way of posing the problem is ill conceived and no solution is needed.},

Indeed, holding science to a unanimity or near-unanimity standard has a pernicious effect on scientific deliberation, and on the transparency that is so crucial to the authority of science in a democracy. What authorizes a conclusion is the quality of the deliberation that produced it, which is enhanced by the presence of a non-dismissible minority. Scientists can speak as one in more ways than one. We recommend a different sort of consensus that is partly substantive and partly procedural. It is a version of what Margaret Gilbert calls $\backslash$textquotedblleft\{\}joint acceptance$\backslash$textquotedblright -- we call it $\backslash$textquotedblleft\{\}deliberative acceptance.$\backslash$textquotedblright It capitalizes on there being a persistent minority, and thereby encourages accurate reporting of the state of agreement and disagreement among deliberators.},

He contends that Christian beliefs are warranted to the extent that they are formed by properly functioning cognitive faculties, thus, insofar as they are warranted, Christian beliefs are knowledge if they are true.

The construct of bullshit has received little scholarly attention; although it is known as a common phenomenon in academic speech and writing, it has rarely been the subject of empirical research. This study is comprised of a protocol analysis of one writer as she attempted to produce an academic essay on a topic in which her understanding of the plays content was insufficient for the task of producing the essay. The coding system identified subcodes within the major categories of content, genre, and process that enabled the researchers to infer what is involved in academic bullshitting. The analysis found that, in the absence of sufficient content knowledge, a writer familiar in discourse conventions may employ knowledge of the genre of academic writing and processes for producing generic features to create the impression that her content knowledge is adequate. The study concludes with a discussion of the phenomenon of academic bullshitting and its implications for teaching and learning academic writing.},

Various theories try to give accounts of how measures of this confidence do or ought to behave, both as far as the internal mental consistency of the agent as well as his betting, or other, behaviour is concerned.

This anthology is the first book to give a balanced overview of these theories. It also explicitly relates these debates to more traditional concerns of the philosophy of language and mind, and epistemic logic, namely how belief simpliciter does or ought to behave. The paradigmatic theory, probabilism (which holds that degrees of belief ought to satisfy the axioms of probability theory) is given most attention, but competing theories, such as Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory, and AGM belief revision theory are also considered. Each of these approaches is represented by one of its major proponents.

The papers are specifically written to target advanced undergraduate students with a background in formal methods and beginning graduate students, but they will also serve as first point of reference for academics new to the area.},

abstract = {A modus tollens against zero-dimensional material objects is presented from the premises (i) that if there are zero-dimensional material objects then there are bare particulars, and (ii) that there are no bare particulars. The argument for the first premise proceeds by elimination. First, bare particular theory and bundle theory are motivated as the most appealing theories of property exemplification. It is then argued that the bundle theorist’s Ockhamism ought to lead her to reject spatiotemporally located zero-dimensional property instances. Finally, it is argued that since she must accept such instances if she accepts zero-dimensional material object bundles, she ought to avoid the latter. This leaves bare particular theory as the default view of zero-dimensional material objects. The argument for the second premise invokes the thesis that the exemplification of at least one sparse property is a prerequisite for the existence of any particular. It is argued from Humean considerations that bare particulars fail this prerequisite.},

Traditional Bayesian modeling techniques have trouble answering this question because their updating rule fails when applied to situations involving contextsensitivity. This essay develops a fully general framework for modeling stories involving context-sensitive claims. The key innovations are a revised conditionalization rule and a principle relating models of the same story with different modeling languages. The essay then applies the modeling framework to the Sleeping Beauty Problem, showing that when Beauty awakens her degree of belief in heads should be one-third. This demonstrates that it can be rational for an agent who gains only self-locating beliefs between two times to alter her degree of belief in a non-self-locating claim.},

Featuring contributors from philosophy, religious studies, and theology, it is unified by the way in which the authors engage in sustained critical examination of one another's positions. John Hick's pluralism provides one focal point of the collection. Hick argues that all the major religious traditions make contact with the same ultimate reality, all offering equally effective paths to salvation or liberation. Another central position is William P. Alston's defense of the Christian practice of forming beliefs about manifestations of God in response to experiences of divine presence or activity. Articles by Hick and Alston develop their arguments and other selections respond. Religious skepticism, religious exclusivism, religious inclusivism, and other perspectives are also represented.

The logic of common belief is formalized in a highly idealized semantic framework that identifies belief with truth in all doxastic alternatives, which are represented by a binary relation of accessibility for each believer. Common beliefs \& individuals' beliefs about common beliefs are derived from ordinary individual beliefs, \& presupposition accommodation is characterized as a natural kind of belief change; a notion of common ground is developed in terms of acceptance to allow for divergence between common ground \& common belief due to accommodation to a recognition of defective contexts. 24 References.

This assumes a "multiple scoreboards" version of contextualism. But contextualists themselves typically opt for "single scoreboard" views on which such apparently competing claims really do conflict.

I argue that both for the layperson and for the intellectual, it is almost never rational to accept such a conspiracy theory. Knowledge is not merely shallowly social, in the manner recognized by social epistemology, it is also constitutively social: many kinds of knowledge only become accessible thanks to the agent's embedding in an environment that includes other epistemic agents. Moreover, advances in knowledge typically require ongoing immersion in this social environment. But the intellectual who embraces a conspiracy theory risks cutting herself off from this environment, and therefore epistemically disabling herself. Embracing a conspiracy theory therefore places at risk the ability to engage in genuine enquiry, including the enquiry needed properly to evaluate the conspiracy theory.},

Finding common ground between Collins and Franklin, I offer a characterization of the gravity wave dispute as both social and evidential.

Quine rejects this defense as resting on an untenable conception of analyticity. But, Carnap doesn't need analyticity. Holistic verificationism about theories, which he and Quine then shared, is sufficient to resurrect the claim that no new content results when abstract objects are added to the ontology of empirical theories. To defeat this claim, one must abandon reductionist views of theory content. This paper extends and deepens the discussion of an earlier publication on the same topic.},

While not everyone accepts that the secularization thesis has been decisively refuted, the resurgence of religion seems$\backslash$n to be a fact, one that can either be lamented or celebrated. Those who lament it often invoke the specter of religious violence: religion has a dangerous tendency to provoke and exacerbate violence wherever it is not domesticated and removed from public $\backslash$npower by the secular state. According to this line of thought, religion has this lamentable tendency because it is an essentially non-rational impulse, a passion that frequently eludes or exceeds the attempts of reason to tame it. The frightful specter of$\backslash$n religious fanaticism in the modern world is offered as evidence of the dan- gerous extremes to which untamed religious passion can tend if not brought to heel by a secular social order},

However, I argue, either there is some interest at stake in knowing or there is not. If there is not, then there is no irresponsibility. If there is, it is either the inquirer's interests -- in which case it is a prudential shortcoming -- or someone else's interests are at stake -- in which case it is a moral shortcoming. In no case, I argue, is there any need to postulate a form of normativity in epistemology other than the traditional epistemological norm that one's attitudes should fit the evidence one has.},

It characterizes entitlement as fulfillment perceptual of an epistemic norm that is apriori associated with a certain function representational that can be known apriori to be a function of perception. The paper connects anti individualism, a thesis about the nature of mental states, and perceptual entitlement. It presents an argument that explains the objectivity and validity of perceptual entitlement partly in terms of the nature of perceptual states?hence the nature of perceptual beliefs, which are constitutively associated with perceptual states. The paper discusses that an individual can be entitled to perceptual belief ways through its connection to perception, and ways that entitlement to perceptual belief can be undermined.},

abstract = {The book explores the relations between these two ways of seeing beliefs. It argues that the binary conception, although it fits nicely with much of our common-sense thought and talk about belief, cannot in the end support the traditional deductive constraints on rational belief. Binary beliefs that obeyed these constraints could not answer to anything like our intuitive notion of epistemic rationality, and would end up having to be divorced from central aspects of our cognitive, practical, and emotional lives. But this does not mean that logic plays no role in rationality. Probabilistic coherence should be viewed as using standard logic to constrain rational graded belief. This probabilistic constraint helps explain the appeal of the traditional deductive constraints, and even underlies the force of rationally persuasive deductive arguments. Graded belief cannot be defined in terms of preferences. But probabilistic coherence may be defended without positing definitional connections between beliefs and preferences. Like the traditional deductive constraints, coherence is a logical ideal that humans cannot fully attain. Nevertheless, it furnishes a compelling way of understanding a key dimension of epistemic rationality.},

Judy is dropped in an area that is divided vertically in Blue (B) and Red (R) and horizontally in Headquarters (Q) and Second Company (S). These divisions define four quadrants, as in Figure 1 (roman script headings). Judy initially believes that there is an equal chance of being in each quadrant. She is then told by a fully reliable source that if she is in R, then there is a chance of q > 0.50 that she is in Q. Now ask yourself: what should Judy's credence be that she is in B on the basis of this information? I am interested here in the limiting case of this problem in which q = 1.

My primary concern is with the instrumentalist conception of epistemic rationality: the view that epistemic rationality is simply a species of instrumental rationality, viz. instrumental rationality in the service of one's cognitive or epistemic goals. After sketching the relevance of the instrumentalist conception to debates over naturalism and "the ethics of belief", I argue that, despite enjoying considerable popularity among both epistemologists and philosophers of science, it is ultimately indefensible. Having thus argued for the distinctness of epistemic and instrumental rationality, I attempt to clarify the role played by each in typical instances of theoretical reasoning. I suggest that being theoretically rational--that is, being proficient with respect to theoretical reasoning--is best construed as a hybrid virtue, inasmuch as it involves manifesting sensitivity to two very different kinds of reasons.},

The key claim in this argument is that the goal of representing the world as accurately as possible is best served by having credences that are probabilistically coherent. This essay shows that this claim is false. In certain cases, the goal of having accurate credences is best served by being probabilistically incoherent.

abstract = {The detection of extrasolar planets presents a good case in which to clarify the distinction between observation and inference from evidence. By asking whether these planets have been observed or inferred from evidence, and by using the scientific details to answer the question, we will get a clearer understanding of the epistemic difference between these two forms of information. The issue of scientific realism pivots on this distinction, and the results of this case will help to articulate the epistemically important factors in assessing theoretical claims. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Austin1994,
abstract = {Legal positivism is the thesis that the existence and content of lawdepends on social facts and not on its merits. The English jurist JohnAustin (1790-1859) formulated it thus: “The existence of law isone thing; its merit and demerit another. Whether it be or be not isone enquiry; whether it be or be not conformable to an assumedstandard, is a different enquiry.” (1832, p. 157) The positivistthesis does not say that law's merits are unintelligible, unimportant,or peripheral to the philosophy of law. It says that they do notdetermine whether laws or legal systems exist. Whether asociety has a legal system depends on the presence of certainstructures of governance, not on the extent to which it satisfiesideals of justice, democracy, or the rule of law. What laws are inforce in that system depends on what social standards its officialsrecognize as authoritative; for example, legislative enactments,judicial decisions, or social customs. The fact that a policy would bejust, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason forthinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust,unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason fordoubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has beenposited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might sayin a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a socialconstruction. Austin thought the thesis “simple andglaring.” While it is probably the dominant view amonganalytically inclined philosophers of law, it is also the subject ofcompeting interpretations together with persistent criticisms andmisunderstandings., (IP) It is not necessarily the case that there is a connectionbetween law and morality.},

@article{Chalmers2014,
abstract = {David Chalmers develops a picture of reality on which all truths can be derived from a limited class of basic truths. The picture is inspired by Rudolf Carnap's construction of the world in Der Logische Aufbau Der Welt. Carnap's Aufbau is often seen as a noble failure, but Chalmers argues that a version of the project can succeed. With the right basic elements and the right derivation relation, we can indeed construct the world. The focal point of Chalmers' project is scrutability: the thesis that ideal reasoning from a limited class of basic truths yields all truths about the world. Chalmers first argues for the scrutability thesis and then considers how small the base can be. The result is a framework in "metaphysical epistemology": epistemology in service of a global picture of the world. The scrutability framework has ramifications throughout philosophy. Using it, Chalmers defends a broadly Fregean approach to meaning, argues for an internalist approach to the contents of thought, and rebuts W.V. Quine's arguments against the analytic and the a priori. He also uses scrutability to analyze the unity of science, to defend a sort of conceptual metaphysics, and to mount a structuralist response to skepticism. Based on Chalmers's 2010 John Locke lectures, Constructing the World opens up debate on central philosophical issues concerning knowledge, language, mind, and reality.},

abstract = {The term “nonrational” denotes a heterogeneous class of theories of decision making designed to overcome problems with traditional “rational” theories. Nonrational theories have been denoted by various terms, including models of bounded rationality, procedural rationality, and satisfi cing. Although there is as yet no agreed-upon defi nition of “nonrational,” rational and nonrational theories typically differ on several dimensions, discussed below. The term “decision making” is used broadly here to include preference, inference, classifi cation, and judgment, whether con- scious or unconscious. Nonrational theories of decision making should not be confused with theories of irrational decision making. The label “nonrational” signifi es a type of theory, not a type of outcome. In other words, the fact that nonrational theories postulate agents with emotions, limited knowl- edge, and little time—rather than postulating omniscient “rational” beings—need not imply that such agents fare badly in the real world.},

@article{Eriksson2007,
abstract = {Probabilism is committed to two theses: 1) Opinion comes in degrees-call them degrees of belief, or credences. 2) The degrees of belief of a rational agent obey the probability calculus. Correspondingly, a natural way to argue for probabilism is: i) to give an account of what degrees of belief are, and then ii) to show that those things should be probabilities, on pain of irrationality. Most of the action in the literature concerns stage ii). Assuming that stage i) has been adequately discharged, various authors move on to stage ii) with varied and ingenious arguments. But an unsatisfactory response at stage i) clearly undermines any gains that might be accrued at stage ii) as far as probabilism is concerned: if those things are not degrees of belief, then it is irrelevant to probabilism whether they should be probabilities or not. In this paper we scrutinize the state of play regarding stage i). We critically examine several of the leading accounts of degrees of belief: reducing them to corresponding betting behavior (de Finetti); measuring them by that behavior (Jeffrey); and analyzing them in terms of preferences and their role in decision-making more generally (Ramsey, Lewis, Maher). We argue that the accounts fail, and so they are unfit to subserve arguments for probabilism. We conclude more positively: 'degree of belief' should be taken as a primitive concept that forms the basis of our best theory of rational belief and decision: probabilism.},

@article{Lewis1994,
abstract = {Disturbance is a dominant factor in many ecosystems, and the disturbance regime is likely to change over the next decades in response to land-use changes and global warming. We assume that predictions of vegetation dynamics can be made on the basis of a set of life-history traits that characterize the response of a species to disturbance. For crown-fire ecosystems, the main plant traits related to postfire persistence are the ability to resprout (persistence of individuals) and the ability to retain a persistent seed bank (persistence of populations). In this context, we asked (1) to what extent do different life-history traits co-occur with the ability to resprout and/or the ability to retain a persistent seed bank among differing ecosystems and (2) to what extent do combinations of fire-related traits (fire syndromes) change in a fire regime gradient? We explored these questions by reviewing the literature and analyzing databases compiled from different crown-fire ecosystems (mainly eastern Australia, California, and the Mediterranean basin). The review suggests that the pattern of correlation between the two basic postfire persistent traits and other plant traits varies between continents and ecosystems. From these results we predict, for instance, that not all resprouters respond in a similar way everywhere because the associated plant traits of resprouter species vary in different places. Thus, attempts to generalize predictions on the basis of the resprouting capacity may have limited power at a global scale. An example is presented for Australian heathlands. Considering the combination of persistence at individual (resprouting) and at population (seed bank) level, the predictive power at local scale was significantly increased.

abstract = {I give an analysis of how empirical terms do their work in communication and the gathering of knowledge that is fully externalist and that covers the full range of empirical terms. It rests on claims about ontology. A result is that armchair analysis fails as a tool for examining meanings of ‘basic’ empirical terms because their meanings are not determined by common methods or criteria of application passed from old to new users, by conventionally determined ‘intensions’. Nor do methods of application used by individual speakers constitute definitive reference-determining intensions for their idiolect terms or associated concepts. Conventional intensions of non-basic empirical terms ultimately rest on basic empirical concepts, so no empirical meaning is found merely ‘in the head’. I discuss the nature of lexical definition, why empirical meanings cannot ultimately be modelled as functions from possible worlds to extensions, and traps into which armchair analysis of meaning can lead us. A coda explains how ‘Swampman’ examples, as used against teleosemantic theories of content, illustrate such traps. "Dictionaries aim to provide definitions that contain sufficient information to impart an understanding of the term. It is a fact about us language users that we somehow come to understand and use a potential infinity of sentences containing a term once we are given a certain small amount of information about the term. Exactly how this happens is a large mystery. But it does happen, and dictionaries exploit the fact. Note that dictionary entries are not unique. Different dictionaries can give different bits of information and yet be equally effective in explaining the meanings of terms." " (Gupta 2008, para 1.2)"},

David Lewis isolated one argument and called it "Putnam's Paradox".(2) That argument is clear and concise; so is the paradoxical conclusion it purports to demonstrate; and so is Lewis' paradox-avoiding solution. His solution involves a position I call "anti-nominalism": not only are classes real, but they are divided into arbitrary and 'natural' classes. The natural classes 'carve nature at the joints', being (as other philosophers might say) the extensions of 'real' properties, universals, or Forms.(3) Thus the argument was turned, in effect, into support for a metaphysical realism stronger than Putnam envisaged.},

abstract = {Fill in the blank: Truth is to belief, as \_\_\_ is to degree of belief. Orthodox Bayesianism requires exactly this much of you: your credences should be coherent—conform to the probability calculus—and they should change under the impact of new evidence by conditionalizing on that evidence. The scandal of orthodox Bayesianism is its extreme permissiveness, sanctioning as it does credences that are radically out of step with the world. We are hardly so tolerant when it comes to all-or- nothing beliefs: it is generally acknowledged that truth is a virtue (perhaps the most important one) that a belief may or may not have. What is the analogous virtue for a degree of belief? Van Fraassen, Lange and others would fill in the blank by appeal to the notion of calibration, a measure of the extent to which degrees of belief track corresponding relative frequencies. I marshal several arguments against this answer. My own answer is: agreement with objective chance. Some will complain that the notion of chance is mysterious, or even nonsense. I reply by pointing out several things that we know about chance. The centerpiece of my argument is a ‘magic trick’: Give me any object, any number between 0 and 1 inclusive, and a specified accuracy, and I will use the object to generate an event whose chance is the number given to the accuracy specified.},

In spite of this fact, the analysis of where these priors come from and how they are formed has received little attention. It is reasonable to excuse the lack, in the foundational literature, of detailed psychological theory of what are the mechanisms by which prior probabilities are formed. But it is less excusable that there is an almost total absence of a detailed discussion of the highly differentiating nature of past experience in forming a prior. The focus here is on what kind of account, even if necessarily schematic, can be given about the psychological mechanisms back of the formation of Bayesian priors.

But alternative rules based on distance functions between probability assignments that allegedly can handle the problem seem to have counterintuitive consequences. Taking our cue from a recent proposal by Bradley, we argue that Jeffrey’s rule can solve the Judy Benjamin problem after all. Moreover, we show that the specific instance of Jeffrey’s rule that solves the Judy Benjamin problem can be underpinned by a particular distance function. Finally, we extend the set of distance functions to ones that take into account the varying degrees to which propositions may be epistemically entrenched.},

abstract = {Critics of contemporary metaphysics argue that it attempts to do the hard work of science from the ease of the armchair. Physics, not metaphysics, tells us about the fundamental facts of the world, and empirical psychology is best placed to reveal the content of our concepts about the world. Exploring and understanding the world through metaphysical reflection is obsolete. In this paper, I will show why this critique of metaphysics fails, arguing that metaphysical methods used to make claims about the world are similar to scientific methods used to make claims about the world, but that the subjects of metaphysics are not the subjects of science. Those who argue that metaphysics uses a problematic methodology to make claims about subjects better covered by natural science get the situation exactly the wrong way around: metaphysics has a distinctive subject matter, not a distinctive methodology. The questions metaphysicians address are different from those of scientists, but the methods employed to develop and select theories are similar. In the first section of the paper, I will describe the sort of subject matter that metaphysics tends to engage with. In the second section of the paper, I will show how metaphysical theories are classes of models and discuss the roles of experience, common sense and thought experiments in the construction and evaluation of such models. Finally, in the last section I will discuss the way these methodological points help us to understand the metaphysical project. Getting the right account of the metaphysical method allows us to better understand the relationship between science and metaphysics, to explain why doing metaphysics successfully involves having a range of different theories (instead of consensus on a single theory), to understand the role of thought experiments involving fictional worlds, and to situate metaphysical realism in a scientifically realist context.},

According to the alethic pluralist, there are several ways of being true, and according to the logical pluralist, there are several ways of being valid. Each of these three forms of pluralism will be considered on its own, but the ambition of the paper is to explore possible connections between them. My primary objective is to present and develop a positive account according to which the different forms of pluralism are intimately related. I will proceed in two steps. First, I will investigate the connection between alethic pluralism and logical pluralism. I will argue that a certain version of alethic pluralism supports logical pluralism. Second, I will connect alethic pluralism and logical pluralism to metaphysical pluralism. I will suggest that the former two are at least partly founded on the latter.},

abstract = {The pragmatic character of the Dutch book argument makes it unsuitable as an "epi- stemic" justification for the fundamental probabilist dogma that rational partial beliefs must conform to the axioms of probability. To secure an appropriately epistemic jus- tification for this conclusion, one must explain what it means for a system of partial beliefs to accurately represent the state of the world, and then show that partial beliefs that violate the laws of probability are invariably less accurate than they could be otherwise. The first task can be accomplished once we realize that the accuracy of systems of partial beliefs can be measured on a gradational scale that satisfies a small set of formal constraints, each of which has a sound epistemic motivation. When ac- curacy is measured in this way it can be shown that any system of degrees of belief that violates the axioms of probability can be replaced by an alternative system that obeys the axioms and yet is more accurate in every possible world. Since epistemically rational agents must strive to hold accurate beliefs, this establishes conformity with the axioms of probability as a norm of epistemic rationality whatever its prudential merits or defects might be.},

abstract = {Speech analysis and synthesis by linear prediction is based on the assumption that the short-time spectral envelope of speech can be represented by a number of poles. An all-pole representation does not provide an accurate description of speech spectra, particularly for nasals and nasalized sounds. This paper presents a method for characterizing speech in terms of the parameters of a pole-zero model. In this method, an impulse response representing the composite filtering action of the glottal wave, the vocal tract, the radiation, and the speech recording system is first constructed from the speech signal. This impulse response is obtained by performing several stages of all-pole LPC analysis. The pole-zero parameters are determined from the impulse response by solving a set of simultaneous linear equations. The method, being noniterative, is very suitable for automatic analysis of speech. The method has been applied to real speech data and the results show that the speech spectra derived from the pole-zero model agree very closely with the actual spectra derived by direct Fourier analysis},

abstract = {The discovery that the universe is fine-tuned for life ? a discovery to which the phrase ?the anthropic principle? is often applied ? has prompted much extra-cosmic speculation by philosophers, theologians, and theoretical physicists. Such speculation is referred to as extra-cosmic because an inference is made to the existence either of one unobservable entity that is distinct from the cosmos and any of its parts (God) or of many such entities (multiple universes). In this article a case is mounted for the sceptical position that cosmic fine-tuning does not support an inference to anything extra-cosmic. To that end three definitions of ?fine-tuned for life? are proposed: the ?slight difference? definition, the (unconditional) probability definition, and John Leslie?s conditional probability definition. These three definitions are the only ones suggested by the relevant literature on fine-tuning and the anthropic principle. Since on none of them do claims of fine-tuning warrant an inference to something extracosmic, it is concluded that there is no definition of ?fine-tuned for life? serving this function.},

@article{Lewis1976a,
abstract = {Facial neuromuscular dysfunction severely impacts adaptive and expressive behavior and emotional health. Appropriate treatment is aided by quantitative and efficient assessment of facial motion impairment. We validated a newly developed method of quantifying facial motion, automated face analysis (AFA), by comparing it with an established manual marking method, the Maximal Static Response Assay (MSRA). In the AFA, motion of facial features is tracked automatically by computer vision without the need for placement of physical markers or restrictions of rigid head motion. Nine patients (seven women and two men) with a mean age of 39.3 years and various facial nerve disorders (five with Bell's palsy, three with trauma, and one with tumor resection) participated. The patients were videotaped while performing voluntary facial action tasks (brow raise, eye closure, and smile). For comparison with MSRA, physical markers were placed on facial landmarks. Image sequences were digitized into 640 x 480 x 24-bit pixel arrays at 30 frames per second (1 pixel congruent with0.3 mm). As defined for the MSRA, the coordinates of the center of each marker were manually recorded in the initial and final digitized frames, which correspond to repose and maximal response. For the AFA, these points were tracked automatically in the image sequence. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate consistency of measurement between manual (the MSRA) and automated (the AFA) tracking methods, and paired t tests were used to assess the mean difference between methods for feature tracking. Feature measures were highly consistent between methods, Pearson's r = 0.96 or higher, p < 0.001 for each of the action tasks. The mean differences between the methods were small; the mean error between methods was comparable to the error within the manual method (less than 1 pixel). The AFA demonstrated strong concurrent validity with the MSRA for pixel-wise displacement. Tracking was fully automated and provided motion vectors, which may be useful in guiding surgical and rehabilitative approaches to restoring facial function in patients with facial neuromuscular disorders},

@article{Tollefsen2006,
abstract = {Recent discussions of rational deliberation in science present us with two extremes: unbounded optimism and sober pessimism. Helen Longino (1990) sees rational deliberation as the foundation of scientific objectivity. Miriam Solomon (1991) thinks it is overrated. Indeed, she has recently argued (2006) that group deliberation is detrimental to empirical success because it often involves groupthink and the suppression of dissent. But we need not embrace either extreme. To determine the value of rational deliberation we need to look more closely at the practice and practitioners of science. I offer a closer look here by exploring the joint agency of small research teams. Although there are factors that contribute to the suppression of dissent in group contexts, a closer look at the literature on group dynamics suggests that there are ways to mitigate the effects of groupthink. Thus, there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the value of rational deliberation within certain scientific contexts},

I ndeed the general difference of opinion between statisticians who for the most part adopt the frequency theory of probability and logicians who mostly reject it renders it likely that the two schools are really discussing different things, and that the word "probability" is used by logicians in one sense and by statisticians in another.

@article{Longino2005,
abstract = {Helen Longino’s paper, “Circles of Reason,” distinguished three kinds of mental activity: “not reasoning”, “reasoning”, and “reasoning well”. In making these distinctions, she aims to avoid missteps made by moderns and post-moderns. Moderns, to generalize broadly, only say what it is to reason well—typically, to follow “the scientific method” as they describe it. Those who do not reason well are not reasoning at all. So moderns drop out the middle category. This has led, historically, to intolerance of reasonable alternative practices. Post-moderns, also generalizing broadly, view all belief generating mechanisms as on a par, so they collapse all the categories together, and lose the ability to make normative judgments at all. Longino’s suggestion is to characterize the middle category, “reasoning,” in normative terms, as the ability to distinguish relevant evidence. It is an achievement to be reasoning at all, rather than engaging in some other mental activity. Different epistemic practices may consider evidence in different ways (they may weight some kinds of evidence more heavily than others, for example), but all are reasoning practices so long as they distinguish relevant evidence in their projects of inquiry. “Circles of Reason” may be viewed as another route to Longino’s critical contextual empiricism (Longino 2002), which requires of scientific communities that they, at the very least, share the valuing of empirical success.},

abstract = {There is a higher incidence of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy responsive to immunomodulating treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis is often overlooked and the patients are given the label of "diabetic neuropathy." Progressive symmetric or asymmetric motor deficit, progressive sensory neuropathy in spite of optimal diabetic control, and unusually high cerebrospinal fluid protein level in "diabetic neuropathy" should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying treatable demyelinating peripheral neuropathy masquerading as "diabetic neuropathy."

@article{Andersen2010,
abstract = {Recently, several scholars have argued that scientists can accept scientific claims in a collective process, and that the capacity of scientific groups to form joint acceptances is linked to a functional division of labor between the group members. However, these accounts reveal little about how the cognitive content of the jointly accepted claim is formed, and how group members depend on each other in this process. In this paper, I shall therefore argue that we need to link analyses of joint acceptance with analyses of distributed cognition. To sketch how this can be done, I shall present a detailed case study, and on the basis of the case, analyze the process through which a group of scientists jointly accept a new scientific claim and at a later stage jointly accept to revise previously accepted claims. I shall argue that joint acceptance in science can be established in situations where an overall conceptual structure is jointly accepted by a group of scientists while detailed parts of it are distributed among group members with different areas of expertise, a condition that I shall call a heterogeneous conceptual consensus. Finally, I shall show how a heterogeneous conceptual consensus can work as a constraint against scientific change and address the question how changes may nevertheless occur.},

@article{Source2011a,
abstract = {This article describes a theory of the computations underlying the selection of coordinated motion patterns, especially in reaching tasks. The central idea is that when a spatial target is selected as an object to be reached, stored postures are evaluated for the contributions they can make to the task. Weights are assigned to the stored postures, and a single target posture is found by taking a weighted sum of the stored postures. Movement is achieved by reducing the distance between the starting angle and target angle of each joint. The model explains compensation for reduced joint mobility, tool use, practice effects, performance errors, and aspects of movement kinematics. Extensions of the model can account for anticipation and coarticulation effects, movement through via points, and hierarchical control of series of movements. References: 170},

@incollection{goldberg_reductionism_2006,
abstract = {This paper aims to correct two common and related misconceptions in discussions of the epistemology of testimony. The first misconception is that testimonial knowledge is an epistemically distinct kind of knowledge only if there are testimony-specific epistemic principles implicated in the justification of beliefs formed through testimony. The second misconception is that anyone who endorses a reductionist position regarding the epistemic status of testimony, and so who denies the existence of testimony-specific epistemic principles, ipso facto ought to be hostile to the hypothesis that testimonial knowledge is epistemically distinctive. I argue against both misconceptions by arguing for the distinctiveness hypothesis in a way that involves no premise any reductionist should want to deny.},

@article{Duddy2012,
abstract = {In the literature on judgment aggregation, an important open question is how to measure the distance between any two judgment sets. This is relevant for issues of social choice: if two individuals hold different beliefs then we might want to find a compromise that lies somewhere between them. We propose a set of axioms that determine a measure of distance uniquely. This measure differs from the widely used Hamming metric. The difference between Hamming's metric and ours boils down to one axiom. Given judgment sets A and B, this axiom says that if the propositions in \$\$\{A $\backslash$cap B\}\$\$ jointly imply that the propositions in A− B share the same truth value, then the disagreement between A and B over those propositions in A− B should be counted as a single disagreement. We consider the application of our metric to judgment aggregation, and also use the metric to measure the distance between preference rankings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
